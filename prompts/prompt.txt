I have the FuelAid project running. Now I need to implement/verify all features as described in the project synopsis. Please work through the following systematically:

## PHASE 1: Database Schema Setup

1. Create/verify MongoDB collections and schemas for:
   - Users (customers) with driving license verification fields
   - Mechanics with professional credentials and GPS location fields
   - FuelDeliveryBoys with experience and background verification
   - ServiceRequests with status tracking (pending, assigned, in-progress, completed, cancelled)
   - Feedback with ratings (1-5 stars) and reviews
   - Receipts with PDF storage paths

2. Ensure all schemas have proper validation and indexes for geolocation queries

## PHASE 2: Authentication & User Management

3. Implement Customer Module:
   - Registration form with driving license upload/verification
   - Login/logout with Passport.js and session management
   - User dashboard with service request history
   - Profile management

4. Implement Mechanic Module:
   - Registration with professional credentials upload
   - Location-tracked login (capture GPS coordinates on login)
   - Mechanic verification workflow (admin approval required)
   - Mechanic dashboard

5. Implement Fuel Delivery Module:
   - Hiring application form with experience details
   - Background verification fields
   - Admin approval workflow
   - Fuel delivery personnel dashboard

6. Implement Admin Module:
   - Admin login with elevated privileges
   - User management interface
   - Approval workflows for mechanics and fuel delivery boys

## PHASE 3: Service Request System

7. Create service request forms for customers:
   - Roadside Assistance request
   - Vehicle Maintenance request
   - Fuel Delivery request
   - Location input (manual address OR GPS auto-detect)
   - Service description text area
   - Contact information fields

8. Implement proximity-based matching:
   - Use Geolib to calculate distances
   - Filter mechanics within 100 km radius of customer
   - Display available mechanics sorted by distance

9. Create mechanic request acceptance:
   - Show nearby requests on mechanic dashboard
   - Accept/decline buttons
   - Auto-assign request to accepting mechanic
   - Update request status to "assigned"

## PHASE 4: Real-Time Tracking with Socket.io

10. Implement Socket.io events:
    - "serviceStatusUpdate" - broadcast status changes
    - "locationUpdate" - stream mechanic location
    - "newServiceRequest" - notify mechanics
    - "requestAccepted" - notify customer

11. Create live tracking interface:
    - Integrate Leaflet.js map on customer dashboard
    - Show mechanic's live location marker
    - Show customer's location marker
    - Draw route line between them
    - Display ETA using Haversine distance calculations

12. Implement mechanic location streaming:
    - Capture mechanic GPS every 30 seconds
    - Emit location updates via Socket.io
    - Update marker position in real-time on customer's map

## PHASE 5: Service Status Management

13. Create status update system:
    - Mechanic can update status: "en route", "arrived", "working", "completed"
    - Each status change triggers Socket.io notification
    - Display status timeline on customer dashboard
    - Show current status with color coding

14. Implement post-service workflow:
    - Mechanic submits service notes and observations
    - Mark service as completed
    - Trigger receipt generation

## PHASE 6: PDF Receipt Generation

15. Implement PDFKit receipt creation:
    - Auto-generate PDF on service completion
    - Include: Service details, customer info, mechanic info, date/time, service notes, amount
    - Save PDF to /uploads/receipts/ folder
    - Store file path in database

16. Create receipt viewing:
    - Display receipt list on customer dashboard
    - Download/view PDF button
    - Email receipt to customer (optional email integration)

## PHASE 7: Feedback & Rating System

17. Implement feedback submission:
    - Show feedback form after service completion
    - Star rating (1-5 stars) with radio buttons or star icons
    - Text review area
    - Submit and store in Feedback collection

18. Display feedback on dashboards:
    - Show customer feedback on mechanic profile
    - Admin can view all feedback
    - Calculate average rating for each mechanic

## PHASE 8: Admin Control Panel

19. Create admin dashboard with:
    - Pending approvals (mechanics, fuel delivery boys)
    - All service requests with filters (status, date)
    - Real-time service monitoring
    - User management (view/edit/delete)

20. Implement manual assignment:
    - Admin can manually assign requests to specific mechanics/fuel delivery boys
    - Override automatic matching if needed

21. Create analytics views:
    - Total services completed
    - Average response time
    - Customer satisfaction ratings
    - Active mechanics/fuel delivery personnel

## PHASE 9: Fuel Delivery Specific Features

22. Implement fuel delivery workflow:
    - Admin assigns fuel delivery request to fuel boy
    - Fuel boy views assigned deliveries
    - Track customer location on map
    - Confirm fuel quantity delivered (input field)
    - Mark delivery completed
    - Generate fuel delivery receipt

## PHASE 10: Dashboard Auto-Refresh

23. Implement auto-refresh for mechanic dashboard:
    - Set interval to refresh every 20 minutes
    - Fetch new nearby service requests
    - Update request list without full page reload

## PHASE 11: OpenCage API Integration

24. Integrate OpenCage Geocoding:
    - Forward geocoding: Convert address to lat/lng
    - Reverse geocoding: Convert lat/lng to address
    - Validate and standardize addresses
    - Use in service request location input

## PHASE 12: UI/UX Enhancements

25. Ensure responsive design:
    - Bootstrap grid system for all pages
    - Mobile-friendly layouts
    - Test on different screen sizes

26. Add loading indicators:
    - Show spinner when fetching location
    - Loading state during service request submission
    - Map loading indicator

27. Implement notifications:
    - Flash messages for success/error
    - Real-time notifications for status updates
    - Browser notifications (optional)

## PHASE 13: Testing & Debugging

28. Test all user flows:
    - Customer registration → service request → tracking → completion → feedback
    - Mechanic registration → approval → accept request → update status → complete
    - Admin approval → manual assignment → monitoring

29. Verify all Socket.io connections:
    - Test real-time updates on multiple browser tabs
    - Ensure location streaming works
    - Check for memory leaks

30. Test geolocation features:
    - Verify 100 km radius filtering
    - Test distance calculations
    - Ensure ETA accuracy

## PHASE 14: Security & Validation

31. Implement input validation:
    - Server-side validation for all forms
    - Sanitize user inputs
    - File upload validation (license, credentials)

32. Ensure route protection:
    - Protect customer routes (require customer login)
    - Protect mechanic routes (require mechanic login)
    - Protect admin routes (require admin privileges)

## Configuration Checklist:

- [ ] .env file with MONGO_URI and OPENCAGE_API_KEY
- [ ] MongoDB connection successful
- [ ] All npm packages installed
- [ ] Socket.io configured and running
- [ ] File upload directories created (/uploads, /public/uploads)
- [ ] Session secret configured
- [ ] Passport.js strategies configured

Please implement these features step by step. After each phase, test the functionality and let me know if there are any errors or issues. Start with Phase 1 and proceed systematically.
